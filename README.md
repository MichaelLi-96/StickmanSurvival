A vintage 2D “Shooter” style game that will be based on the theme of the “space invader” style games of the past. The game leverages the object-oriented and graphics capabilities of OpenFrameworks and applies the basics of game interaction, 2D game graphics using sprites, rudimentary collision detection and basic animation.
